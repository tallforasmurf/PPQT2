The HTML translator converts DP Format (with all PPQT extensions as described
in the Suggested Workflow document) into HTML.

It puts a page-break anchor and visible page number at each page boundary.
The visible number is the folio value as set in the Pages panel. It also
updates the PPQT metadata for page boundaries, so scan images should still
display correctly while you are editing the HTML document.

It checks that all footnote keys are unique. If a non-unique key is used, it
puts an error message in the HTML file. Also, it checks that the key in a
Footnote has previously been used as a footnote anchor, and if not, it puts
an error message in the HTML file. These errors can be prevented by using the
Footnotes panel to renumber all footnotes.

It puts the title and author values from the book facts into the HTML header.
Right-click in the Edit panel and select Edit Book Facts to set these before
doing the Translation.

The DP format permits a Chapter Head to have multiple paragraphs. This is
almost never done, but if a Chapter Head does have two or more paragraphs,
all the paragraphs in the head will be marked with <h2>. This should be
obvious when the document is displayed in a browser. Manually change the
second paragraph of a Chapter head to something else.

HTML header lines and CSS definitions are installed at the top of the output
document. To customize one particular book, edit these lines in the new
document. If you want to change these definitions for all future
translations, edit the file Translators/html.py. The HTML and CSS values are
coded at the end of that file as constants.
