This directory contains dictionaries for the hunspell spellchecker.

Each dictionary consists of two files: name.dic and name.aff.

Files ending in .dic are the dictionaries.
Files ending in .aff are the "affix" rule files associated with each dict.

A dictionary does not exist to PPQT unless BOTH files are present.

Use the Preferences dialog to set the path to this folder.
When you have done that, the names of dictionaries will appear in 
the pop-up list in the Preferences dialog for Default Dictionary,
and in the pop-up list when you select Dictionaries... from the
context menu of an edit panel.

To add or replace a dictionary, find a Myspell-compatible
(or Hunspell-compatible) dictionary somewhere.
Place the name.dic and name.aff files in this folder.
