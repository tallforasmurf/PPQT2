<h2>Acknowledgements and History<a class="headerlink" href="#acknowledgements-and-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea of an integrated editor with special features for
post-processing originated with Steve Shulz (Thundergnat), who created Guiguts,
the program that inspired PPQT and provided most of its ideas.</p>
<p>Version 1 of PPQT (Post-Processing in Qt)
was written in 2011-12 and has been successfully used by a few people.
Mark Summerfield&#8217;s book
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html">Rapid GUI Development with PyQt</a>
was an essential learning tool when writing PPQT.</p>
<p>Although PPQT V1 is still functional even now, it has shortcomings and
a clumsy internal design.
This, Version 2, has a cleaner internal structure,
adds the ability to have multiple books open at once,
and stores metadata in JSON format, among many other changes.</p>
<p>Most important, Version 2 makes a clean division between the <em>editorial</em>
tasks of post-processing, such as healing page breaks, checking spelling,
moving footnotes and the like,
and the <em>translation</em> of the final, clean etext
into other markup formats like fp, or delivery formats such as HTML, EPUB, etc.</p>
<p>It defers those tasks to pluggable translator modules that can be supplied
by  others, making PPQT2 an open-ended application.</p>

<span id="id1"></span><h1>The Big Picture<a class="headerlink" href="#the-big-picture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>PPQT is an editor designed for post-processing books that have
been prepared by the volunteers of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pgdp.net">Distributed Proofreaders</a>.</p>
<p>On the left side of the main window is an area for editing the text
of book files. You can open several book files.
Each open book file appears as a tab.
Only one book file is visible and active at any time.</p>
<p>On the right side is a set of tabs that open panels with different
functions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#images-panel">Images panel</a> displays the scan images for the pages of the active book.
It usually shows the image for the location of the edit cursor.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#notes-panel">Notes panel</a> is a simple editor where you can keep notes about your work
on a book. The notes are saved and loaded with the book.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#find-panel">Find panel</a> lets you do search and replace. It has many special features
including support for full (PCRE) regular expressions and
the ability to save complex searches for later use.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#characters-panel">Characters panel</a> shows all the characters used in the book.
You can quickly find non-ASCII characters, or replace special
characters with HTML entity codes.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#words-panel">Words panel</a> shows all the words used in the book, with their
counts. You can quickly find all words that fail spell-check here.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#pages-panel">Pages panel</a> lists all the page boundaries. Here you can
adjust the visible page numbers (folios) to match the original book.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#footnote-panel">Footnote panel</a> organizes all footnotes. Here you can find
footnote errors, and move footnotes to the end of a chapter or
end of the book.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference internal" href="#bookloupe-panel">Bookloupe panel</a> lets you run the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juiblex.co.uk/pgdp/bookloupe/">Bookloupe program</a> and display
all its diagnostic messages in a table you can sort by message
or by line number for easy editing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each open book has its own set of these panels.
When you make a book text active on the left side, the panels
for that book appear on the right side.</p>
<p>You use these features to bring a book into
perfect conformity with the DP <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Formatting Guidelines</a>.
You check all formatting.
You remove page separator lines and fix the words or footnotes
that were broken across pages.
You move footnotes, sidenotes, and illustrations into their
proper locations.
You handle all proofer queries.
You resolve all spellcheck errors.
And so on.</p>
<p>When the book is 100% correct per the Guidelines,
you apply one of the <a class="reference internal" href="#translators">Translators</a> to convert the book to a
different form such as HTML.</p>
<p>The translated book text appears in a new edit panel in PPQT.
You may continue to edit it there, or save it and process it with
some other program.</p>
<div class="section" id="extras">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Extras<a class="headerlink" href="#extras" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The &#8220;Extras&#8221; folder is a folder of useful things that is distributed
along with PPQT. Here are the things you can find there:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This very file, &#8220;ppqt2help.html&#8221; is there. You can open it in
any browser.</li>
<li>&#8220;Suggested_workflow.rtf&#8221; describes the steps of post-processing in detail
and shows how to use the features of PPQT at each step.</li>
<li>en-common-ltn.txt is a file of common &#8220;scannos&#8221;. See <a class="reference internal" href="#marking-scannos">Marking Scannos</a>.</li>
<li>The &#8220;dictionaries&#8221; folder contains spell-check dictionaries for several languages.</li>
<li>Two monospaced fonts, Liberation Mono and Cousine, are stored here.
They are especially well suited to post-processing. PPQT loads these
fonts when it starts up, if it can find them.</li>
<li>Several sets of saved Find/Replace operations are here.
You can load them into the <a class="reference internal" href="#find-panel">Find panel</a> to do complex searches.
For example, &#8220;common_errors.utf&#8221;
has regular-expression searches for common text errors such as
whitespace preceding punctuation or a paragraph that starts with
a lowercase letter.</li>
<li>&#8220;Translator_API.utf&#8221; tells Python programmers how to write a
translator to work with PPQT.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="files-and-folders">
<h1>Files and Folders<a class="headerlink" href="#files-and-folders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When you open a book file, say <cite>bookname</cite><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.utf</span></code>,
PPQT expects to find two things in the same folder:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>bookname</cite><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.utf.ppqt</span></code> is a file of information about the book
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#metadata">Metadata</a>). It is created the first time you save the book.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pngs</span></code> is a folder that contains the scanned page images for this book.
These are the images that are shown in the <a class="reference internal" href="#images-panel">Images panel</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also looks in the same folder for spelling dictionaries;
see <a class="reference internal" href="#dictionaries">Dictionaries</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="unicode-and-fonts">
<h2>Unicode and Fonts<a class="headerlink" href="#unicode-and-fonts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The book text is held in memory as Unicode, so it may use
virtually any alphabet or special characters.
There are two restrictions.</p>
<p>PPQT can only display characters that are defined in the
font you select (see <a class="reference internal" href="#edit-font">Edit font</a>).
For example the DPCustomMono2 font familiar to DP proofers
lacks Greek and Cyrillic.
The Liberation Mono and Cousine fonts have characters from several languages
and many symbols.</p>
<p>Second, although it can display alphabets such as Arabic and Hebrew
if they are in the current font,
PPQT does not understand right to left editing.
The edit cursor only moves left to right during text entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-encodings-and-file-names">
<h2>File Encodings and File Names<a class="headerlink" href="#file-encodings-and-file-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Characters in a file are encoded somehow.
The preferred encoding for modern text files is UTF-8.
This encoding can store any Unicode character.
PPQT <em>expects</em> book files to be encoded UTF-8.
PPQT always saves its <a class="reference internal" href="#metadata">Metadata</a> file in UTF-8.</p>
<p>Another common encoding is Latin-1 (also called ISO8859-1).
PPQT <em>allows</em> book files to be encoded in Latin-1.
Before you open a book file encoded Latin-1, you must give it
a filename that ends in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span></code> (for example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">latinbook-l.txt</span></code>),
or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-ltn</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">latinbook-ltn.txt</span></code>)
or else give it the file suffix <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.ltn</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">latinbook.ltn</span></code>).
When PPQT opens or saves a file named in any of these ways, it
uses the Latin-1 encoding.</p>
<p>If the text in your book is strictly ASCII, PPQT will handle it correctly
no matter how the book is named.
ASCII is a proper subset of both UTF-8 and Latin-1.</p>
<p>There are many other encodings (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding#Common_character_encodings">here is a list</a>),
such as the &#8220;Windows CP1252&#8221; encoding
often found in older Windows files.
PPQT does not support any encodings except UTF-8 and Latin-1.</p>
<p><strong>If you open a file and find its special characters are scrambled,
close it immediately without saving it.</strong>
If it is encoded Latin-1, rename it.
Otherwise, use some other utility  to convert it to UTF-8.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-main-window">
<h1>The Main Window<a class="headerlink" href="#the-main-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The main window is divided into left and right halves.
The left half is for editing.
The right half is for the Image, Find, Notes and other panels.</p>
<p>You can make the window larger by dragging a corner.
You can slide the &#8220;splitter&#8221; bar left and right.
The position and size of the window and position of the splitter are
remembered from one session to the next.</p>
<p>If you quit PPQT with books open, it remembers their names.
When you start PPQT, it asks if you want to re-open those books.
Otherwise, it starts with one empty book named &#8220;Untitled-0&#8221;.</p>
<p>When you tell PPQT to Quit, it checks to see if any open book has been modified
since it was saved.
For each modified file it asks you if you want to save it.
You can save, not save, or cancel the Quit.</p>
<p>The main window has two important features, the Preferences dialog and the File menu.</p>
<div class="section" id="preferences">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Preferences<a class="headerlink" href="#preferences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You find the Preferences dialog in the File menu (Windows and Linux)
or under the Application menu (Mac OS).
The Preferences dialog lets you choose three different file paths,
a default spell-check dictionary,
the font for the editor,
and four kinds of text highlighting used in the editor.</p>
<p>Your choices are saved when the PPQT ends and restored when it next starts up.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the dialog are four buttons:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Set Defaults:</dt>
<dd>Sets all the preference choices to default values and Applies them.</dd>
<dt>Cancel:</dt>
<dd>Closes the dialog without applying any further changes.</dd>
<dt>Apply:</dt>
<dd>Applies any changes you have made.</dd>
<dt>OK:</dt>
<dd>Applies all changes you have made and closes the dialog.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="bookloupe-path">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>Bookloupe path<a class="headerlink" href="#bookloupe-path" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#bookloupe-panel">Bookloupe panel</a> displays the messages produced by the
Bookloupe program.
PPQT needs to know the path to the bookloupe executable.
Otherwise, the Bookloupe panel will remain empty.</p>
<p>If you have not installed Bookloupe, you can find it at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juiblex.co.uk/pgdp/bookloupe/">Bookloupe home page</a>.</p>
<p>You can click the Browse button to find the bookloupe program,
or you can type or paste the file path into the text field.
You must enter a path to a file that is readable and executable.
If the path is not to a readable, executable file the text field
remains pink and the choice will not be applied.</p>
<p>Although PPQT ensures that you choose an executable file it does not
verify that the file is in fact, bookloupe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extras-path">
<span id="id5"></span><h3>Extras path<a class="headerlink" href="#extras-path" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#extras">Extras</a> folder is where PPQT looks for this help file
and other useful things.</p>
<p>You can click the Browse button to find the folder,
or you can type or paste the file path into the text field.
You must enter a path to a folder that is readable.
If the path is not to a readable folder, the text field
remains pink and the choice will not be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dictionaries-path">
<span id="id6"></span><h3>Dictionaries path<a class="headerlink" href="#dictionaries-path" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PPQT looks for spelling dictionaries in three places:
first, in the folder of the current book file;
second in the folder you choose here;
third in the Extras folder.</p>
<p>When PPQT is distributed, there is a folder named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dictionaries</span></code>
inside the Extras folder
that contains dictionaries for several languages.
However, you can move or copy that folder to some other place,
or create a dictionary folder of your own.
Use this preference to set the path to your folder of dictionaries.</p>
<p>You can click the Browse button to find the folder,
or you can type or paste the file path into the text field.
You must enter a path to a folder that is readable.
If the path is not to a readable folder, the text field
remains pink and the choice will not be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="default-dictionary">
<span id="id7"></span><h3>Default Dictionary<a class="headerlink" href="#default-dictionary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you open a book for the first time, or when you create a new, empty file,
PPQT assigns this spelling dictionary.
Choose the dictionary for the language used by most of the books you work on.</p>
<p>The pop-up list contains all the dictionaries found on the <a class="reference internal" href="#dictionaries-path">Dictionaries path</a>
and on the <a class="reference internal" href="#extras-path">Extras path</a>.
If you change those paths, the contents of this pop-up list changes.</p>
<p>You can change the spelling dictionary assigned to a book: see <a class="reference internal" href="#dictionaries">Dictionaries</a>.
The name of the dictionary is saved with the book.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#edit-panel">Edit panel</a> displays text using this font.
You can change the size of the font at any time in each Edit panel.
Here you choose the font family for all edit panels.
Choose a monospaced font that clearly distinguishes similar letters
(1/l, O/0, B/8) and has a good repertoire of characters.</p>
<p>The pop-up list contains all monospaced fonts known in your system.
It includes Liberation Mono and Cousine if those fonts are in the Extras folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="edit-highlights">
<span id="id9"></span><h3>Edit Highlights<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-highlights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are four choices of text highlighting:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scanno highlighting sets how &#8220;scannos&#8221; (words that are often scanned
incorrectly in the OCR process) are marked.
The default is a light purple background.</li>
<li>Spellcheck highlighting sets how words that fail spellcheck are marked.
The default is a wiggly red underline.</li>
<li>Find Range highlighting sets how the extent of a limited Find range is marked
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#find-range">Find range</a>).
The default is a light cyan background.</li>
<li>Current line highlighting sets how the text line with the edit cursor
is marked.
The default is a very pale yellow background.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each kind of highlighting, you choose whether it uses an underline
or a background color.
If you select &#8220;No Underline&#8221; from the pop-up list, the highlight is applied
as a background color.
If you select one of the underline styles, the highlight is applied as
an underline in that style.</p>
<p>You select the color of the highlight by clicking the small color swatch.
A color-choice dialog is presented.
The color you choose is set in the swatch.</p>
<p>When you change the color or the underline style, the text sample
changes to show the effect.</p>

<div class="section" id="file-menu">
<h2>File Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#file-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="file-new">
<h3>File: New<a class="headerlink" href="#file-new" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

It has no data and is not modified.
The <a class="reference internal" href="#default-dictionary">Default Dictionary</a> is assigned to it.</p>
<p>If you save this file you will be asked to give it a name.
When you save it, a <a class="reference internal" href="#metadata">Metadata</a> file will also be created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-open">
<h3>File: Open<a class="headerlink" href="#file-open" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This displays a dialog to open an existing file.
Choose the book file to edit.
The contents of the book file are displayed in a new <a class="reference internal" href="#edit-panel">Edit panel</a>.
If there is a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pngs</span></code> folder in the same location, the images in it
are displayed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#images-panel">Images panel</a>.</p>
<p>If there is a <a class="reference internal" href="#metadata">Metadata</a> file in the same folder, PPQT knows
that this book has been saved before.
PPQT reads the metadata file and restores all the information about
the book that is in it.
For example, it restores the default dictionary for the book,
and any <a class="reference internal" href="#bookmarks">Bookmarks</a> you had set.</p>
<p>PPQT checks that the metadata file matches the book file.
It is possible, for example, to restore the book file from backup but
not the metadata file.
If the metadata was not saved at the same time as the book, PPQT warns you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="opening-for-the-first-time">
<span id="first-open"></span><h3>Opening for the first time<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-for-the-first-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When there is no metadata file, PPQT assumes this is the first time the
book has been opened.
In this case it does the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">It assigns the <a class="reference internal" href="#default-dictionary">Default Dictionary</a> and initializes other metadata.
When you save the book, a metadata file will also be created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It scans the book text looking for page-separator lines like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-----File:</span> <span class="pre">006.png---\proofer\puffer\ruffler\fiddlestix\--------</span></code></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The position of these lines is noted in the <a class="reference internal" href="#pages-panel">Pages panel</a>.
The names
of the image files (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">006.png</span></code> in the example) are saved for use by
the <a class="reference internal" href="#images-panel">Images panel</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It looks for a file named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">good_words*.*</span></code>
and if one exists, its contents are loaded as the list of words that are
not spell-checked but are always correctly spelled.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#good-words-list">Good words list</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It also looks for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bad_words*.*</span></code>
and loads its contents as the list of words that are always wrongly spelled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as with the book file, PPQT <em>assumes</em> the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">good_words</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bad_words</span></code>
files are encoded UTF-8.
If they are Latin-1, you need to tell PPQT by making their filenames
end in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-ltn</span></code> or giving them the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.ltn</span></code> suffix: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">good_words.ltn</span></code>.</p>
<p>The good- and bad-word files are only read on this occasion.
Their contents are saved in the metadata file.
You can edit the good-words list in the <a class="reference internal" href="#words-panel">Words panel</a>.</p>

<p>Most words in the book are checked for spelling against the dictionary you have assigned
to the book.
The <a class="reference internal" href="#default-dictionary">Default Dictionary</a> is assigned when a book is opened for the first time.</p>
<p>Choose the Dictionary... action in the context menu to assign a different dictionary.
It presents a list of dictionaries as found in the following places:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First, the folder containing the book file.
If you want to use a certain dictionary for this book only, put a copy of the
dictionary in the book folder.</li>
<li>Second, the <a class="reference internal" href="#dictionaries-path">Dictionaries path</a> is searched for dictionary files.
Any dictionaries found there are added to the list.</li>
<li>Finally, the <a class="reference internal" href="#extras-path">Extras path</a> is searched for dictionary files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dictionaries are named with two lowercase letters for the language
and two uppercase letters for the nation.
For example, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">en_GB</span></code> is English for Great Britain; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fr_CA</span></code> is French for Canada.
If there are dictionaries with the same name, for example if there are two
dictionaries with the name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">en_GB</span></code>, the one found first in the above sequence is shown.</p>
<p>When you assign a different dictionary, PPQT re-checks the spelling of all words.</p>
<p>You can have specific words checked against an alternate dictionary.
You do this by surrounding those words with any HTML code containing
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lang=</span></code> property. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;span</span> <span class="pre">lang='fr_FR'&gt;Je</span> <span class="pre">t'aime&lt;/span&gt;</span> <span class="pre">he</span> <span class="pre">whispered.</span></code></div></blockquote>
<p>The words <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">je</span> <span class="pre">t'aime</span></code> will be spell-checked against dictionary <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fr_FR</span></code>
provided a dictionary of that name exists somewhere in the dictionary search path
given above.</p>
<p>You may put the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lang=</span></code> property in any HTML markup, but it is probably
best to only use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">span</span></code> markup for this purpose.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#translators">Translators</a> may or may not support the use of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">span</span></code> markup or the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lang=</span></code> property.</p>

The image files must be stored as files of type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.png</span></code> in a folder named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pngs</span></code>
in the same folder as the book.</p>
<p>When the book is opened for the first time, the names of the image files
are copied from the page-separator lines.
Each time the edit cursor enters the text of a different book page,
the Images panel displays the image file for that page.</p>
<p>You can zoom the page image from the keyboard.
Click on the image and then key control-+ to zoom in (larger)
and control-minus to zoom out (smaller).
The zoom changes by about 16% each time.</p>
<p>When the image is too large to fit in the window,
scroll bars appear on the bottom and right side.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the panel there are three zoom controls.
You can use the numeric box to specify a zoom value from 15% up to 200%.
You can click the &#8220;to Height&#8221; button to zoom the image so that the printed part
fills the window top to bottom.
Click &#8220;to Width&#8221; to zoom the image so that the printed part
fills the window from side to side.
These buttons take any dark pixels as part of the printing.
If there is a marginal note or some kind of blob or fly-speck on the page,
the buttons may not zoom as much as you expect.</p>
<p>Normally the Images panel follows the edit cursor.
As you move the cursor through the text, the image changes to match.
You can disable this by clicking the little hand icon at the top left of the panel.
When that hand is open, moving the edit cursor has no effect on the image.
When the hand is closed, the edit panel &#8220;grips&#8221; the image panel,
and the images follow the edit cursor.</p>
<p>You can click in the Images panel and then use the Page Up and Page Down
keys to step through images.
Do this when you want to look at some page before or after the current page.
Normally this has no effect on the edit cursor.
You can change this by clicking the little hand icon at the bottom left of the panel.
When that hand is closed, the Images panel &#8220;grips&#8221; the edit panel.
If you use Page Up or Page Down in the Images panel, the edit cursor will
follow along.</p>

<span id="id16"></span><h1>Notes Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Notes panel is a simple text editor.
Use it to keep notes about the book as you process it.
For example you might make notes on</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>typos you find and correct</li>
<li>usage of special characters</li>
<li>a to-do list of things not to forget</li>
<li>drafts of your Transcriber&#8217;s Note</li>
<li>complex tables or other special formatting that needs attention</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of the Notes panel are saved in the <a class="reference internal" href="#metadata">Metadata</a> file
and loaded again when the book is opened.</p>
<p>While the focus is in the Notes panel, the Edit menu has commands
for Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste, Find and Find-Next, with the usual
keyboard accelerators.
The Find operation is a local search within the note text.</p>
<p>With the focus in the Notes panel, key shift-ctl-m to insert
the line number of the book edit cursor, in curly braces: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{2217}</span></code>.
Use this feature to note a location, for instance the line where
a typo is found.</p>
<p>Place the cursor in or near one of these line numbers and key ctl-m.
The book edit panel jumps to that line number.</p>
<p>Key shift-ctl-p to insert the page number of the book edit cursor
in square brackets: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[138]</span></code>.
Use this to note the location of, for example, a table you need to format.</p>
<p>Place the cursor in or near one of these page numbers and key ctl-p.
The book edit panel will jump to the top of that page.</p>

<p>The top group of controls are for searching.
In the center is a large text-entry field.
Here you enter the text you want to find in the book.</p>
<p>Just left of the search text field is a small clock icon.
This reveals a pop-up list of up to ten recent searches.
To repeat a search, select it in this list.</p>
<p>Below the search text are four buttons:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>First</strong></dt>
<dd>looks for the search text starting at the top of the book
(or the top of the range).
It finds the first occurrence of the text.</dd>
<dt><strong>Last</strong></dt>
<dd>looks for the search text starting at the <cite>end</cite> of the book
(or the end of the range) and searching <cite>backward</cite>.
It finds the last occurrence of the text.</dd>
<dt><strong>Next</strong></dt>
<dd>looks for the search text moving forward from the current
cursor location.
It stops looking at the end of the book (or the end of the range).</dd>
<dt><strong>Prior</strong></dt>
<dd>looks for the search text moving <cite>backward</cite> from the current
cursor location.
It stops looking at the top of the book (or top of the range).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Above the search text are four switches:</p>
<p>When <strong>Respect Case</strong> is on (✓), letter case is significant: A≠a.
When it is off, letter case is ignored.</p>
<p>When <strong>Whole Word</strong> is on (✓), normal searches will only match to
complete words.
This switch is disabled during regular-expression searches.
(In a regular expression, use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\b</span></code> to find a word-boundary.)</p>
<p>When <strong>Regex</strong> is on (✓), the search text is a <a class="reference internal" href="#regular-expression">regular expression</a>.
When it is off, the search text is compared normally</p>
<p><strong>In Range</strong> is used to confine search and replace to a
limited range of the book text.</p>

For example, suppose you are working on the Table of Contents,
and you want to make use find/replace to make changes only in that part of the book.</p>
<p>Select the Table of Contents by clicking at the top of it,
and shift-clicking at the end.
Then on the Find panel, click <strong>In Range</strong>.
The text selection will be highlighted to show it is now
a Find Range.
(The highlight is normally light-blue, but see <a class="reference internal" href="#edit-highlights">Edit highlights</a>.)</p>
<p>Now searches and replaces will take place in that range only.
A &#8220;replace all&#8221; will replace all matches but only in the range.

<div class="section" id="controls-for-replacing">
<h2>Controls for Replacing<a class="headerlink" href="#controls-for-replacing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three replace text fields.
You can use any of the fields to replace the last text you found.
For example, suppose you want to search for bold markup
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;b&gt;</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;/b&gt;</span></code>).
Some of the time you want to replace the markup with a double asterisk,
and sometimes you want to delete it.
Set the Find text to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;/?b&gt;</span></code> and turn on <strong>Regex</strong>.
Put the double asterisk in the first replace field.
Clear the second replace field.
Click <strong>First</strong>.
Then decide: replace or delete?
Click the first <strong>Replace</strong> button to replace the found text with the asterisks.
Click the second <strong>Replace</strong> button to replace it with nothing, that is, to delete it.
Click <strong>Next</strong> and repeat.</p>
<p>Each replace field has its own <strong>Replace</strong> button.
Each has a clock icon that pops up a list of recent replacement strings.</p>
<p>A <strong>Replace</strong> button only works when the current selection in the Edit panel
was created by a Find.
If you perform a Find and then move the cursor, the <strong>Replace</strong> buttons are disabled.</p>
<p>To the right of the replace fields are three switches.</p>
<dl class="docutils">

Choose the name and location for the small file.
You might save it with the book, or in Extras, or anywhere you like.
The file that is created is a text file encoded UTF-8.
It contains definitions of all the non-empty buttons.
Buttons marked &#8220;(empty)&#8221; are not saved.</p>
<p>You may edit a file of saved buttons.
(PPQT is not a good editor for this. Use some other simple text editor.)
In the Extras folder is a file named &#8220;Syntax of find buttons&#8221;.
One reason to edit a file of buttons is to add &#8220;tooltip&#8221; strings to them.</p>
<p>To load a file of buttons, select File &gt; Load Find Buttons.

<p>The Words panel displays all the words in the book.
Use it to find words that are often errors.
In particular the Words panel is your best tool for correcting spelling.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to update the words and their counts after editing.</p>
<p>Click on any column heading to sort the table on that column.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: at this time, the Refresh operation takes several seconds.
It may also take several seconds to sort the table when you click on a column heading.
This is apparently due to a problem in Qt table sorting.</p>
<p>The table shows three items about each word:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The word itself.
PPQT defines a &#8220;word&#8221; rather loosely.
A &#8220;word&#8221; may include digits, hyphens and apostrophes.
&#8220;Mother-in-law&#8217;s&#8221; is a word, as is &#8220;1925ʼs&#8221; (note the curly apostrophe).</li>
<li>The count of times the word appears in the book.</li>
<li>The &#8220;features&#8221; of the word. Features include:<ul>
<li>&#8216;A&#8217; if the word contains an uppercase letter.</li>
<li>&#8216;a&#8217; if the word contains a lowercase letter</li>
<li>&#8216;9&#8217; if the word contains a digit</li>
<li>&#8216;h&#8217; if the word contains a hyphen</li>
<li>&#8216;p&#8217; if the word contains an apostrophe</li>
<li>&#8216;X&#8217; if the word fails spellcheck</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The uppercase and lowercase features are Unicode-aware.</p>
<p>A word has the hyphen feature if it contains the Latin-1 hyphen (\u002d)
or the Unicode hyphen (\u2010).
(See also the &#8220;Similar words&#8221; feature below.)</p>
<p>, non-breaking hyphen (\u2011), figure dash (\u2012),
en-dash, (\u2013), small figure dash (\ufe58),
small hyphen-minus (\ufe63), and fullwidth hyphen-minus (\uff0d).</p>
<p>The check for apostrophe allows the (Latin-1 quote \u0027)
and the Unicode modifier letter apostrophe (\u02bc)
and right single quote (\u2019).</p>
<p>Set the <strong>Respect Case</strong> switch on or off to change the way the
table sorts the first column.</p>
<p>With the focus in the Word panel, key any letter.
The table scrolls to put the first word starting with that letter in the middle of the window.</p>
<div class="section" id="searching-for-a-word">
<h2>Searching for a word<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-for-a-word" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Double-click any word.
The Find panel is displayed.
The text of that word is in the find text field.
<strong>Respect Case</strong> and <strong>Whole Word</strong> are checked.
The first occurrence of the word is in the middle of the edit panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filtering-the-words">
<h2>Filtering the words<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-the-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the upper right of the panel is a pop-up menu of &#8220;filters&#8221;.
You can filter the table to show only:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All-uppercase words</li>
<li>All-lowercase words</li>
<li>Mixed-case words (words with both an uppercase and a lowercase letter)</li>
<li>All-numeric words</li>
<li>Alpha-numeric words (words with at least one letter and one digit)</li>
<li>Hyphenated words</li>
<li>Words containing an apostrophe</li>
<li>Words that fail spellcheck</li>
</ul>
<p>The file &#8220;Suggested Workflow&#8221; in the Extras folder describes
the procedure for correcting spelling errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id21">
<h2>Context Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#id21" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Right-click on a row to open a context menu with three actions.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Words Similar to This</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Filters the table to show only words that are like the clicked word,

<p class="last">If the word is &#8220;to-day&#8221;, similar words include &#8220;To-Day&#8221; and &#8220;today&#8221;.
Use this to find inconsistent usage of hyphens and apostrophes.
In particular this filter skips all Unicode characters that
are hyphen-like, including non-breaking hyphen (\u2011),
figure dash (\u2012), en-dash, (\u2013), small figure dash (\ufe58),
small hyphen-minus (\ufe63), and fullwidth hyphen-minus (\uff0d).
So if a word looks similar to a hyphenated word, but does not show an
&#8220;h&#8221; in the features column, it may contain one of these &#8220;faux hyphens&#8221;.</p>
</dd>
<dt>First Harmonic</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Filters the table to show words that are the same as that word
except for one edit change: one insertion, or one deletion,

<p class="last">If the word is &#8220;dog&#8221; other words might include
&#8220;doe&#8221; and &#8220;do&#8221; and &#8220;dogs&#8221;, but not &#8220;Dow&#8221; because that needs
two changes (d to D and g to w).</p>

<dt>Second Harmonic</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Filters the table to show words that are the same as that word

insertions) or &#8220;dang&#8221; (one insertion, one change).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The First Harmonic is a good tool for finding format keywords that
proofers might misspell, such as Footnote or Illustration.
For example the First Harmonic of the word <cite>Footnote</cite> would include
<cite>Footnotes</cite> and <cite>footnote</cite>.
The Second harmonic would include <cite>footnotes</cite> and <cite>Footntoe</cite>.</p>

<div class="section" id="pages-panel">
<span id="id23"></span><h1>Pages Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#pages-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Pages panel displays a table with one row for each page boundary in the book.
It is initialized from the page separator lines the first time you open a book
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#first-open">First open</a>).</p>
<p>The first column of the table shows the name of the scanned image file for that page.
For example if the scanned image file is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0078.png</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pngs</span></code> folder,
this column shows 0078.</p>
<p>The fifth column of the table shows a list of the names of the proofers who worked on
that page.</p>
<p>The second, third and fourth columns are used to control the Folio, or visible page number
value for this page.
You use these columns to make the folio numbers agree with the folios printed in the book.
For example, a book might begin with four scanned images
pages that have no number.
Then might come several pages that are numbered in lowercase Roman numerals,
i, ii, ... xvi.
After this, the main part of the book begins with Arabic page number 1 and
continues to the end, perhaps 278.</p>
<p>Column 1 of the table shows the format of the folio for this page.
This column may have any of four values:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Arabic</dt>
<dd>The folio is an Arabic numeral like 399.</dd>
<dt>roman</dt>
<dd>The folio is a lowercase Roman numeral like xiv.</dd>
<dt>ROMAN</dt>
<dd>The folio is an uppercase Roman numeral like XIV.</dd>
<dt>(same)</dt>
<dd>The folio has the same format as the page above it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Column 2 of the table has a rule saying how the folio value for this page is computed:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Omit</dt>
<dd>There is no folio on this page.</dd>
<dt>Add 1</dt>
<dd>The folio is made by adding 1 to the folio of the nearest preceding page
that is not set to &#8220;Omit&#8221;.</dd>
<dt>Set to:</dt>
<dd>The folio is set to a specific number to start a new sequence.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Column 3 of the table shows the result of applying these rules.</p>
<p>When the book is first opened,
the first page is set to format:Arabic, rule:Set to 1.
All other pages are set to format:(same), rule:Add 1.
The result is that the Folio numbers are just the sequence numbers of the scan images.
These numbers will usually match the image names, that is,
image 0027 will have Folio 27.</p>
<p>To change the format, double-click in column 2.
A small pop-up menu appears.
Select Arabic, roman, ROMAN or (same) for that page.</p>
<p>To change the folio rule, double-click in column 3.
A small pop-up menu appears.
Select Omit, Add 1, or Set to:.</p>
<p>If you choose the rule Set to, you can double-click in column 4.
A small numeric entry field appears.
Use it to set the folio value for this page.</p>
<p>In each of these menus, you can cancel the action by keying Escape.
Key Enter to accept the value.</p>
<p>Click the Refresh button to update the table with changes.
For example, double-click the first row, column 4.
Set the starting folio to 5.
Click refresh and see how all the other rows are now
numbered from 5 instead of from 1.</p>
<p>Using this table you can make the folio values agree exactly with the
folios printed in the book.</p>
<p>At the top of the table is a text field.
You can put a string of text here and click Insert.
A warning dialog asks if it is OK to insert text on every page.
If you click OK, the text in the field is inserted at the start of every page.</p>
<p>The inserted text may include the string <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%f</span></code>.
This will be replaced with the folio value on each page.
The text may include %i; it will be replaced with the image filename.</p>

<p>The Footnote panel displays footnotes that are coded according to
the DP formatting guidelines.
Click <strong>Refresh</strong>.
The panel scans the book and displays one row for each footnote.
The Footnote panel works with these definitions:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Anchor</dt>
<dd>An <cite>Anchor</cite> is text in square brackets
that shows where a footnote is used, for example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[A]</span></code>.</dd>
<dt>Note</dt>
<dd>The note begins with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[Footnote</span> <span class="pre">A:</span></code> and a space.
A note may contain many lines of text and other markup
including quotes and tables. It ends with a line in which
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">]</span></code> is the last character on the line.</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>The <cite>Key</cite> of a footnote is the letter, number or symbol that
appears in both the Anchor and the Note and connects them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The table displays the notes in these six columns:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>The letter, number or symbol that appears in this Anchor and Note.</dd>
<dt>Class</dt>
<dd>There are six possible classes of Keys: Arabic (123), ROMAN (IVX),
roman (ivx), lowercase (abc), uppercase (ABC) or symbol (*¤§).</dd>
<dt>Anchor line</dt>
<dd>The line number of the book where the Anchor of this footnote is found.</dd>
<dt>Note line</dt>
<dd>The line number of the book where the Note of this footnote begins.</dd>
<dt>Note length</dt>
<dd>The number of lines of text in this footnote.</dd>
<dt>Note text</dt>
<dd>The first 40 characters or so of the Note.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Click on an Anchor line cell.
The edit cursor jumps to the Anchor line.
Click on a Note line cell.
The edit cursor jumps to the first line of the Note.</p>
<p>Click repeatedly on a Key cell.
The edit cursor jumps between the Anchor line and the Note line.
In this way you can &#8220;bounce&#8221; the cursor back and forth between the
Anchor and the Note.</p>
<div class="section" id="footnote-errors-and-warnings">
<h2>Footnote errors and warnings<a class="headerlink" href="#footnote-errors-and-warnings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If PPQT finds what appears to be an Anchor, but cannot find a Note
with the same Key, it displays that row of the table in pink.
The Note line column is blank.</p>
<p>If PPQT finds what looks like a Note but did not find an Anchor
with the same Key, it displays that row of the table in pink.
The Anchor line column is blank.</p>
<p>If any rows of the table are pink, the <strong>Renumber</strong> and <strong>Move to Zones</strong>
buttons do not work.</p>
<p>If the Note line is 50 or more lines beyond the Anchor line,
the table row is shown in green.
Also if the Note length is greater than 10, the table row is shown in green.
These represent possible errors that should be examined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="renumbering">
<h2>Renumbering<a class="headerlink" href="#renumbering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you click <strong>Renumber</strong>, if there are no pink rows in the table,
PPQT renumbers all the notes.</p>
<p>There are five &#8220;number streams&#8221;, one for each Class of Anchor.
Each stream is initialized to 1, and incremented each time it is used.
For example, the abc stream produces a series of lowercase letters,
from a to zzz. The 123 stream produces a series of Arabic numbers,
from 1 to 999.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Footnote panel are six pop-up menus, one for each
class of Key.
Use these to say which stream will provide the numbers to that class of Key.
For example, you can set class ABC to receive numbers from the 123 stream.
Then all uppercase Keys will be replaced with Arabic numbers.</p>
<p>PPQT looks at each footnote in turn from the top of the book to the end.
It gives that footnote the next sequential number from the stream
you have assigned to its class of Key.</p>
<p>Renumbering footnotes is a single-undo operation.
Click in the Edit panel and key ctl-z to undo it.</p>
<p>Be aware that some Roman numerals are also letters.
If there is a footnote with a Key value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">X</span></code>,
it will be classed as Roman ivx or IVX.
If you renumber all footnotes with uppercase alphabetic Keys,
a few will be classed as Roman.
The ninth footnote will have Key <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">I</span></code> and the 22nd key will
have Key <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">V</span></code>.
To make sure there are no mistakes, when you renumber
with alphabetic Keys,
set the Roman classes to use the same number stream as the alphabetic classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-footnotes">
<h2>Moving Footnotes<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-footnotes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you click <strong>Move to Zones</strong>, if there are no pink rows in the table,
PPQT moves footnotes to marked footnote zones.</p>
<p>You create a footnote zone by inserting two lines:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/F</span></code></div>
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">F/</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>PPQT examines each Note from the top of the book down.
If the Note is not already inside a zone, PPQT looks for a zone
below the Note.
If there is a zone below the Note, the lines of the Note are
moved to the bottom of that zone.</p>
<p>To put all Notes at the ends of the chapters, insert a footnote zone
after the last paragraph of every chapter.
To put all Notes at the end of the book, put a single zone at the
end of the final chapter.</p>
<p>You can insert a level-2 heading or other text into a zone.
The moved notes go to the end of the zone, above the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">F/</span></code> line.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juiblex.co.uk/pgdp/bookloupe/">Bookloupe</a> program is a utility that reads a DP book file
and looks for many different types of common errors.</p>
<p>Using the Bookloupe panel you run Bookloupe against the book being edited.
The many diagnostic messages are displayed in a convenient table.</p>
<p>Before you can use the Bookloupe panel you must install <a class="reference external" href="http://www.juiblex.co.uk/pgdp/bookloupe/">Bookloupe</a>.
Then you must tell PPQT where the executable program is.
Do that with the <a class="reference internal" href="#bookloupe-path">Bookloupe path</a> part of the Preferences panel.</p>
<p>Click Refresh to run Bookloupe.
The current book text is copied to a temporary file.
Bookloupe is started and reads the temporary file.
The messages it prints are captured and displayed in a table
with three columns:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Line#</dt>
<dd>The line number mentioned in the error message.</dd>
<dt>Col#</dt>
<dd>The column number mentioned in the error message</dd>
<dt>Diagnostic message</dt>
<dd>The text of Bookloupe&#8217;s message.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can sort the table by clicking in the column headings.
Sort on Line# if you want to deal with the messages line by line.
Sort on Message text if you want to deal with (or ignore)
each group of similar messages.</p>
<p>Double-click any line.
The edit cursor jumps to the line and column for that message.</p>
<p>At the top of the panel are five checkboxes.
Use these to control five of the Bookloupe command-line options
as described in the Bookloupe documentation file.</p>
<dl class="docutils">

<dt><strong>SQuotes</strong></dt>
<dd>Pass the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-s</span></code> option that causes single-quote

(Use some other plain text editor, not PPQT.)
In some rare circumstances you may have a reason to modify it.
For example you could add or remove words in the Bad words list,
as there is no other way to do that.</p>
<p>When PPQT reads the metadata file, it takes some care to avoid
any errors you might make in editing the metadata file.
If it finds errors, it writes log messages about them,
and skips the bad section.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all new! This is the first release of version 2!
Version 2 is not compatible with Version 1 because the metadata file
format is different.
If you are working on a book using PPQT version 1, complete that book.
Use Version 2 to start your next new project.</p>
<p>Here are the main points of difference (aside from all the shiny
new more efficient Python code underneath):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can open as many books as you like. Each book has its own
set of panels which are switched in as needed.</li>
<li>The editor shows the current line with a highlight.</li>
<li>There is a fancy Preferences dialog.</li>
<li>The Bookloupe panel integrates Bookloupe into the process.</li>
<li>Help is in a separate window, not a panel, so you can position
it where you can read it while looking at another panel.</li>
<li>The Find panel now supports full PCRE regular expressions.
The old &#8220;Greedy&#8221; switch is gone; use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></code> qualifier to
make any expression non-greedy.</li>
<li>It is easier to set a limited Find range, and the range
is colored so you can see where it is.</li>
<li>The HTML and ASCII conversion panels are gone.
In this version, all types of conversions are handled by
plug-ins called Translators.</li>
<li>The HTML preview panel is gone. There are too many different
etext formats, we can&#8217;t provide preview panels for all of them.
Open an HTML file in a browser.
Then just save (ctl-s) in PPQT and click the refresh button on the browser.</li>
