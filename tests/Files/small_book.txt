CHAPTER I


One hears of people whose hair turned white in a
single night. Last night I thought mine was
turning. I had a creepy feeling in the roots,
which seemed to crawl all the way down inside each separate
hair, wriggling as it went. I suppose you couldn't
have nervous prostration of the hair? I worried dreadfully,
it kept on so long; and my hair is so fair it would be
almost a temptation for it, in an emergency, to take the
one short step from gold to silver. I didn't dare switch
on the light in the <i>wagon-lit</i> and peep at my pocket-book
mirror (which reflects one's features in sections of a square
inch, giving the survey of one's whole face quite a panorama
effect) for fear I might wake up the Bull Dog.

I've spelt him with capitals, after mature deliberation,
because it would be nothing less than <i>lÀse majest»</i> to fob
him off with little letters about the size of his two lower
eye-tusks, or chin-molars, or whatever one ought to call
them.

He was on the floor, you see, keeping guard over his
mistress's shoes; and he might have been misguided
enough to think I had designs on them--though what
I could have used them for, unless I'd been going to
Venice and wanting a private team of gondolas, I can't
imagine.

I being in the upper berth, you might (if you hadn't seen
-----File: 013.png---\justinl\susanskinner\TheEileen\fvandrog\-------------
him) have fancied me safe; but already he had once
padded half-way up the step-ladder, and sniffed at me
speculatively, as if I were a piece of meat on the top shelf
of a larder; and if half-way up, why not all the way up?
<i>Il »tait capable du tout.</i>

I tried to distract my mind and focus it hard on other
things, as Christian Scientists tell you to do when you
have a pin sticking into your body for which <i>les convenances</i>
forbid you to make an exhaustive search.

I lay on my back with my eyes shut, trying not to hear
any of the sounds in the <i>wagon-lit</i> (and they were not
confined to the snoring of His Majesty), thinking
desperately. "I will concentrate all my mentality,"
said I to myself, "on thoughts beginning with P, for
instance. My Past. Paris. Pamela."

Just for a few minutes it was comparatively easy.
"Dear Past!" I sighed, with a great sigh which for divers
reasons I was sure couldn't be heard beyond my own
berth. (And though I try always even to <i>think</i> in English,
I find sometimes that the words group themselves in my
head in the old patterns--according to French idioms.)
"Dear Past, how thou wert kind and sweet! How it is
brutalizing to turn my back upon thee and thy charms
forever!"

"Oh, my goodness, I shall certainly die!" squeaked a
voice in the berth underneath; and then there was a sound
of wallowing.

She (my stable-companion, shall I call her?) had been
giving vent to all sorts of strange noises at intervals, for a
long time, so that it would have been hopeless to try and
drown my sorrows in sleep.
-----File: 014.png---\kchawkins\susanskinner\TheEileen\fvandrog\-----------

Away went the Gentle Past with a bump, as if it had
knocked against a snag in the current of my thoughts.

Paris or Pamela instead, then! or both together, since
they seem inseparable, even when Pamela is at her most
American, and tells me to "talk United States."

It was all natural to think of Pamela, because it was
she who gave me the ticket for the <i>train de luxe</i>, and my
berth in the <i>wagon-lit</i>. It[**If?--F1] it hadn't been for Pamela I
should at this moment have been crawling slowly, cheaply,
down Riviera-ward in a second-class train, sitting bolt
upright in a second-class carriage with smudges on my
nose, while perhaps some second-class child shed jammy
crumbs on my frock, and its second-class baby sister
howled.

"Oh, why did I leave my peaceful home?" wailed the
lady in the lower berth.

Heaven alone (unless it were the dog) knew why she
had, and knew how heartily I wished she hadn't. A
good thing Cerberus was on guard, or I might have
dropped a pillow accidentally on her head!

Just then I wasn't thanking Pamela for her generosity.
The second-class baby's mamma would have given it a
bottle to keep it still; but there was nothing I could give
the fat old lady; and she had already resorted to the
bottle (something in the way of patent medicine) without
any good result. Yet, <i>was</i> there nothing I could give her?

"Oh, I'm dying, I <i>know</i> I'm dying, and nobody
cares! I shall choke to death!" she gurgled.

It was too much. I could stand it and the terrible
atmosphere no longer. I suppose, if I had been an early
Christian martyr, waiting for my turn to be devoured
-----File: 015.png---\kchawkins\susanskinner\TheEileen\fvandrog\-----------
might have so got on my nerves eventually that I
would have thrown myself into the arena out of sheer
spite at the lions, and then tried my best to disagree
with them.

Anyway, Bull Dog or no Bull Dog, having made a light,
I slid down from my berth--no thanks to the step-ladder--dangled
a few wild seconds in the air, and then
offering--yes, offering my stockinged feet to the Minotaur,
I poked my head into the lower berth.

"What are you going to do?" gasped its occupant,
<i>la grosse femme</i> whose fault it would be if my hair did
change from the gold of a louis to the silver of a mere
franc.

"You say you're stifling," I reminded her, politely
but firmly, and my tone was like the lull before a storm.

"Yes, but--[**--]"   We were staring into each other's
eyes, and--could I believe my sense of touch, or was it
mercifully blunted? It seemed that the monster on the
floor was gently licking my toes with a tongue like a
huge slice of pink ham, instead of chewing them to the
bone. But there are creatures which do that to their
victims, I've heard, by way of making it easier to swallow
them, later.

"You also said no one cared," I went on, courageously.
"<i>I</i> care--for myself as well as for you. As for what
I'm going to do--I'm going to do several things. First,
open the window, and then--<i>then I'm going to undress
you</i>."

"You must be mad!" gasped the lady, who was
English. Oh, but more English than any one else I ever
saw in my life.
-----File: 016.png---\kchawkins\susanskinner\TheEileen\fvandrog\-----------

"Not yet," said I, as I darted at the thick blind she had
drawn down over the window, and let it fly up with a
snap. I then opened the window itself, a few inches, and
in floated a perfumed breath of the soft April air for
which our bereaved lungs had been longing. The breeze
fluttered round my head like a benediction until I felt that
the ebbing tide of gold had turned, and was flowing into
my back hair again.

"No wonder you're dying, madam," I exclaimed,
switching the heat-lever to "Froid." "So was I, but
being merely an Upper Berth, with no rights, I was suffering
in silence. I watched you turn the heat full on, and shut
the window tight. I saw you go to bed in <i>all</i> your clothes,
which looked terribly thick, and cover yourself up with
both your blankets; but I said nothing, because you were
a Lower Berth, and older than I am. I thought maybe
you <i>wanted</i> a Turkish Bath. But since you don't--I'll
try and save you from apoplexy, if it isn't too late."

I fumbled with brooches and buttons, with hooks and
eyes. It was even worse than I'd supposed. The
creature's conception of a travelling costume <i>en route</i>
for the South of France consisted of a heavy tweed dress,
two gray knitted stay-bodices, one pink Jaeger chemise,
and a couple of red flannel petticoats. My investigations
went no further; but, encouraged in my rescue work
by spasmodic gestures on the part of the patient, and
forbearance on the part of the dog, I removed several
superfluous layers of wool. One blanket went to the
floor, where it was accepted in the light of a gift by His
Majesty, and the other was returned to its owner.

"Now are you better, madam?" I asked, panting with
-----File: 017.png---\Zuza\susanskinner\TheEileen\fvandrog\----------------
long and well-earned breaths. She reposed on an elbow,
gazing up at me as at a surgeon who has performed a
painful but successful operation; and she was an object
<i>pour faire rire</i>, the poor lady!

She wore an old-fashioned false front of hair, "sunning
over with curls" (brown ones, of a brown never seen on
land or sea), and a pair of spectacles, pushed up in an
absent-minded moment, were entangled in its waves.
Her face, which was large, with a knot of tiny features in
the middle, shone red with heat and excitement. She
would have had the look of an elderly child, if it hadn't
been for her bright, shrewd little eyes, which twinkled
observantly--and might sparkle with temper. Nobody
who was not rich and important would dare to dress as
badly as she did. Altogether she was a figure of fun.
Indeed, I couldn't help feeling what quaint mantelpiece
ornaments she and her dog would make. Yet, for some
reason, I didn't feel inclined to laugh, and I eyed her as
solemnly as she eyed me. As for His Majesty, I began
to see that I had misunderstood him. After all, he had
never, from the first, regarded me as an eatable.

"Yes, I <i>am</i> better," replied His Majesty's mistress.
"People have always told me it came on treacherously
cold at night in France, so I prepared accordingly. I
suppose I ought to thank you. In fact, I do thank
you."

"I acted for myself as much as for you," I confessed.
"It was so hot, and you were suffering out loud."

"I have never travelled at night before," the lady
defended herself. "Indeed, I've made a point of travelling
as little as possible, except by carriage. I don't
-----File: 018.png---\Zuza\susanskinner\TheEileen\fvandrog\----------------
consider trains a means of conveyance for gentlefolk.
They seem well enough for cattle who may not mind
being herded together."

"Or for dogs," I suggested.

"Nothing is too good for Beau--my <i>only</i> Beau!" (at
this I did not wonder). "But I wouldn't have moved
without him. He's as necessary to me as my conscience.
I was afraid the guard was going to make a
fuss about him, which would have been awkward, as I
can't speak a word of French, or any other silly language
into which Latin has degenerated. But luckily English
gold doesn't need to be translated."

"It loses in translation," said I, amused. I sat down
on my bag as I spoke, and timorously invited Beau
(never was name less appropriate) to be patted. He arose
from the blanket and accepted my overtures with an
expression which may have been intended for a smile,
or a threat of the most appalling character. I have
seen such legs as his on old-fashioned silver teapots;
and the crook in his tail would have made it useful
as a door-knocker.

"I don't think I ever saw him take so to a stranger,"
exclaimed his mistress, suddenly beaming.

"I wonder you risked him with me in such close
quarters then," said I. "Wouldn't it have been safer if
you'd had your maid in the compartment with you--[**--]"

"My maid? My tyrant!" snorted the old lady.
"She's the one creature on earth I am afraid of, and she
knows it. When we got to Dover, and she saw the
Channel wobbling about a little, she said it was a great
nasty wet thing, and she wouldn't go on it.    When I
-----File: 019.png---\Zuza\susanskinner\Cimon Avaro\fvandrog\--------------
insisted, she showed symptoms of seasickness; and in
consequence she is waiting for me in Dover till I finish
the business that's taking me to Italy. I had no more
experience than she, but I had <i>courage</i>. It's perhaps a
question of class. Servants consider only themselves.
You, too, I see, have courage. I was inclined to think
poorly of you when you first came in, and to wish
I'd been extravagant enough to take the two beds for
myself, because I thought you were afraid of Beau. Yet
now you're patting him."

"I <i>was</i> rather afraid at first," I admitted. "I never met
an English bull dog socially before."

"They're more angels than dogs. Their one interest in
life is love--for their friends; and they wouldn't
hurt a fly."

"Larger game would be more in their way, I should
think," said I. "But I'm glad he likes me. I like to
be liked. It makes me feel more at home in life."

"H'm! That's a funny idea!" remarked the old
lady. "'At home in life!' You've made yourself pretty
well at home in this <i>wagon-lit</i>, anyhow, taking off all your
clothes and putting on your nightgown. I should never
have thought of that. It seems hardly decent. Suppose
we should be killed."

"Most people do try to die in their nightgowns, when
you come to think of it," said I.

"Well, you have a quaint way of putting things.
There's something very original about you, my dear
young woman. I thought you were mysterious at first,
but I believe it's only the effect of originality."

"I don't know which I'd rather be," I said, "original
-----File: 020.png---\Zuza\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\------------------
or mysterious, if I couldn't afford both. But I'm not
a young woman."

"Goodness!" exclaimed the old lady, wrinkling up
her eyes to stare at me. "I may be pretty blind, but it
can't be make-up."

I laughed. "I mean <i>je suis jeune fille</i>. I'm not a
young woman.   I'm a young girl."

"Dear me, is there any difference?"

"There is in France."

"I'm not surprised at queer ideas in France, or any
other foreign country, where I've always understood that
<i>anything</i> may happen. Why can't everybody be English?
It would be so much more simple. But you're not
French, are you?"

"Half of me is."

"And what's the other half, if I may ask?"

"American. My father was French, my mother
American."

"No wonder you don't always feel at home in life,
divided up like that!" she chuckled. "It must be so
upsetting."

"Everything is upsetting with me lately," I said.

"With me too, if it comes to that--or would be, if it
weren't for Beau. What a pity you haven't got a Beau,
my dear."

I smiled, because (in the Americanized sense of the
word) I had one, and was running away from him as
fast as I could. But the thought of Monsieur Charretier
as a "beau" made me want to giggle hysterically.

"You say 'was,' when you speak of your father and
mother," went on the old lady, with childlike curiosity,
-----File: 021.png---\Zuza\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\------------------
which I was encouraging by not going back to bed.
"Does that mean that you've lost them?"

"Yes," I said.

"And lately?"

"My father died when I was sixteen, my mother left
me two years ago."

"You don't look more than nineteen now."

"I'm nearly twenty--one."

"Well, I don't mean to catechize you, though one
certainly must get friendly--or the other way--I
suppose, penned up in a place like this all night. And
you've really been very kind to me. Although you're
a pretty girl, as you must know, I didn't think at first
I was going to like you so much."

"And I didn't you," I retorted, laughing, because I
really did begin to like the queer old lady now, and was
glad I hadn't dropped a pillow on her head.

"That's right. Be frank. I like frankness. Do
you know, I believe you and I would get on very well
together if our acquaintance was going to be continued?
If Beau approves of a person, I let myself go."

"You use him as if he were a barometer."

"There you are again, with your funny ideas! I shall
remember that one, and bring it out as if it were my
<i>own</i>. I consider myself quite lucky to have got you for a
travelling companion. It's such a comfort to hear English
again, and talk it, after having to converse by gesture--except
with Beau.    I hope you're going on to Italy? "

"No.    I'm getting off at Cannes."

"I'm sorry.    But I suppose you're glad?"

"Not particularly," said I.
-----File: 022.png---\Zuza\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\------------------

"I've always heard that Cannes was gay."

"It won't be for me."

"Your relations there don't go out much?"

"I've no relations in Cannes. Aren't you tired now,
and wouldn't you like me to make you a little more
comfortable?"

"Does that mean that <i>you're</i> tired of answering questions?
I haven't meant to be rude."

"You haven't been," I assured her. "You're very
kind to take an interest."

"Well, then, I'm <i>not</i> tired, and I <i>wouldn't</i> like to be
made more comfortable. I'm very well as I am. Do
you want to go to sleep?"

"I want to, but I know I can't. I'm getting hungry.
Are you?"

"Getting? I've <i>got</i>. If Simpkins were here I'd
have her make us tea, in my tea-basket."

"I'll make it if you like," I volunteered.

"A French--a half French--girl make tea?"

"It's the American half that knows how."

"You look too ornamental to be useful. But you
can try."

I did try, and succeeded. It was rather fun, and never
did tea taste so delicious. There were biscuits to go
with it, which Beau shared; and I do wish that people
(other people) were obliged to make faces when they
eat, such as Beau has to make, because if so, one could
add a new interest to life by inviting even the worst
bores to dinner.

I was fascinated with his contortions, and I did not
attempt to conceal my sudden change of opinion con-*
-----File: 023.png---\Markham\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\---------------
*cerning Beau as a companion. When I had humbly
invited him to drink out of my saucer, which I held from
high tide to low, I saw that my conquest of his mistress
was complete. Already we had exchanged names, as
well as some confidences. I knew that she was Miss
Paget, and she knew that I was Lys d'Angely; but after
the tea-drinking episode she became doubly friendly.

She told me that, owing to an unforeseen circumstance
(partly, even largely, connected with Beau) which had
caused a great upheaval in her life, she had now not a
human being belonging to her, except her maid Simpkins,
of whom she would like to get rid if only she knew how.

"Talk of the Old Man of the Sea!" she sighed. "<i>He</i>
was an afternoon caller compared with Simpkins. She's
been on my back for twenty years. I suppose she will
be for another twenty, unless I slam the door of the family
vault in her face."

"Couldn't Beau help you?" I asked.

"Even Beau is powerless against her. She has
hypnotized him with marrow bones."

"You've escaped from her for the present," I suggested.
"She's on the other side of the Channel. Now
is your time to be bold."

"Ah, but I can't stop out of England for ever, and I
tell you she's waiting for me at Dover. A relative (a
very eccentric one, and quite different from the rest of
us, or he wouldn't have made his home abroad) has left
me a house in Italy, some sort of old castle, I believe--so 
unsuitable! I'm going over to see about selling it
for I've no one to trust but myself, owing to the circumstances
of which I spoke. I want to get back as soon as
-----File: 024.png---\rajordan\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\--------------
possible--I hope in a few weeks, though how I shall
manage without any Italian, heaven may know--I
don't! Do you speak it?"

"A little."

"Well, I wish I could have you with me. You'd make
a splendid companion for an old woman like me: young,
good to look at, energetic (or you wouldn't be travelling
about alone), brave (conquered your fear of Beau),
accomplished (three languages, and goodness knows what
besides!), presence of mind (the way you whisked my
clothes off), handy (I never tasted better tea)--altogether 
you sum up ideally. What a pity you're rich,
and out of the market!"

"If I look rich my appearance must be more distinguished 
than I supposed--and it's also very deceiving,"
said I.

"You're rich enough to travel for pleasure in <i>wagon-lits</i>,
and have silver-fitted bags."

"I'm not travelling for pleasure. You exaggerate
my bags and my <i>wagon-lits</i>, for I've only one of each;
and both were given me by a friend who was at the Convent 
with me."

"The Convent! Good heavens! are you an escaping
nun?"

I laughed. "I went to school at a Convent. That
was when I thought I <i>was</i> going to be rich--at least,
rich enough to be like other girls. And if I <i>am</i> 'escaping'
from something, it isn't from the arms of religion."

"If you're not rich, and aren't going to relatives, why
not take an engagement with me? Come, I'm in earnest.
I always make up my mind suddenly, if it's anything
-----File: 025.png---\rajordan\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\--------------
important, and hardly ever regret it. I'm sure we should
suit. You've got no nonsense about you."

"Oh yes I have, lots!" I broke in. "That's all
I have left--that, and my sense of humour. But
seriously, you're very kind--to take me on faith like this--especially 
when you began by thinking me mysterious.
I'd accept thankfully, only--I'm engaged already."

"To be married, I suppose you mean?"

"Thank heaven, no! To a Princess."

"Dear me, one would think you were a man hater!"

"So I am, a <i>one</i>-man hater. What Simpkins is to you,
that man is to me. And that's why I'm on my way
to Cannes to be the companion of the Princess Boriskoff,
who's said to be rather deaf and very quick-tempered, as
well as elderly and a great invalid. She sheds her paid
companions as a tree sheds its leaves in winter. I hear
that Europe is strewn with them."

"Nice prospect for you!"

"Isn't it? But beggars mustn't be choosers."

"You don't look much like a beggar."

"Because I can make my own dresses and hats--and 
nightgowns."

"Well, if your Princess sheds you, let me know, and
you may live yet to deliver me from Simpkins. I feel
you'd be equal to it! My address is--but I'll give
you a card." And, burrowing under her pillow, she
unearthed a fat handbag from which, after some fumbling,
she presented me with a visiting-card, enamelled in an
old-fashioned way. I read: "Miss Paget, 34a Eaton
Square. Broomlands House, Surrey."

"Now you're not to lose that," she impressed upon
-----File: 026.png---\rajordan\susanskinner\prishan\fvandrog\--------------
me. "Write if you're scattered over Europe by this
Russian (I never did believe much in Princesses, excepting,
of course, our <i>own</i> dear Royalties), or if you ever come
to England. Even if it's years from now, I assure you
Beau and I won't have forgotten you. As for your
address--[**--]"

"I haven't any," I said. "At present I'm depending
on the Princess for one. She's at the Hotel Majestic
Palace, Cannes; but from what my friend Pam--the
Comtesse de Nesle--says, I fancy she doesn't stop long
in any town. It was the Comtesse de Nesle who got me
the place. She's the only one who knows where I'm
going, because--after a fashion, I'm running away to
be the Princess's companion."

"Running away from the Man?"

"Yes; also from my relatives who're sure it's my duty
to be <i>his</i> companion. So you see I can't give you their
address. I've ceased to have any right to it. And
now I really think I <i>had</i> better go back to bed."
