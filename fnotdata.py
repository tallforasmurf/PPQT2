                          FNOTDATA.PY

Defines a class to store the footnote info of one Book. Acts as the Data Model
for fnotview.py which displays footnote data and offers user controls.

                    Important nomenclature:

A footnote KEY is a symbol that links an ANCHOR to a NOTE. Typically one
character (such as A or Â¶) but can be multiple such as xviii or 97.

An ANCHOR is a KEY in square brackets[A] (with no spaces). It
* appears in a text but never at column 0
* never appears inside a word, so that [oe] is not an anchor

A NOTE is one or more adjacent complete lines that
* begins in column 0 with [Footnote k: where k is a KEY.
* begins on a line that follows the line containing the matching ANCHOR
* ends with a line having a right square bracket as its last character
* may contain ANCHORs to (sub)footnotes
* may contain square brackets other than Anchors as long as the right
  bracket does not fall at the end of the line (which ends the NOTE).
* may contain poetry, lists, tables, block quotes, nonformatted text
  (/*, /X or /C sections) and transliterations such as [Greek:]
* may NOT contain [Illustration...] or [Sidenote...] markup (because
  these markups also end with a right square bracket at line-end).
* may NOT contain another NOTE: footnotes may not be nested

It is not required that KEYs be unique. (It is common for most KEYs in a PG
text to be proofed as A and a few as B.) However it is required that

(a) the ANCHOR with Key k precedes the NOTE with the matching Key k
(b) NOTES with the same KEY appear in the same sequence as their ANCHORs;
    that is, any Anchor [A] is matched to the first following [Footnote A:

Here is a valid example:

  Text[A] and more text[A]
  ...
  [Footnote A: this note has[i] an anchor.]
  [Footnote A: this note matches the second anchor A and runs
  to multiple -- [text in brackets but not at end of line] --
  lines]
  [Footnote i: inner note anchored in first note A.]

                   Logical Database Structure

The database managed in this module has these logical columns:

Key:            The key text from a footnote, e.g. A or iv or 92.

Class:          The class of the key, one of:
                 0   IVX     uppercase roman numeral
                 1   ABC     uppercase alpha
                 2   ivx     lowercase roman numeral
                 3   abc     lowercase alpha
                 4   123     decimal
                 5   *\u00A4\u00A7 (star, currency, section) symbol class

Anchor Line:     The text block (line) number containing the anchor

Note Line:       The text block number of the matching Note

Length:          The length in lines of the matched Note

Text:            The opening few characters of the Note such as
                [Footnote A: This note has...

The example above might produce the following logical table:

 Key   Class  Anchor Line Note Line   Length   Text
  A     ABC      1535       1570         1      Footnote A: this note has[i..
  A     ABC      1535       1571         3      Footnote A: this is the sec..
  i     ivx      1570       1574         1      Footnote i: inner note refe..

The table is actually maintained as a list of lists, each list having just
two members: [ ACursor, NCursor] where ACursor is a QTextCursor that selects
the the KEY in the ANCHOR, and NCursor selects all the lines of the NOTE.

The other values (key, class, Anchor Line#, Note Line#, Note Length, Note
Text) can be extracted from the two QTextCursors. This has the advantage that
those values remain accurate even while the user is editing the document.

              Refresh Process

Initially the table is empty. The refresh() method is called from the
fnotview module at user request. It scans the document line by line looking
for anchors and notes. We use the QTextDocument find() method and QRegExp
items for this search, because this gives us QTextCursors.

The document is scanned twice, first to build a list of Anchors, then to build
a list of Notes. The two lists are merged and the table is built from
the matching (Anchor, Note) pairs. If any Anchors and Notes remain unmatched
they are stored as mismatched entries (either ACursor or NCursor is None).

              Metadata

Methods _fnote_save() and _fnote_load are registered to read/write footnote
metadata. _fnote_save() writes the database as a list of lists,

  [ [ Aa, Az, Na, Nz ]... ]

where Aa is the position and Az the anchor of the ACursor, and Na is the
position and Nz the anchor of the NCursor, with 0,0 where one cursor is
stored as None. (n.b. an Anchor cannot begin at the start of a line, and a
Note cannot appear in line 0 because it must follow the line containing its
Anchor; hence 0,0 is impossible for either.) From these items fnote_load()
can reconstruct the database by creating QTextCursors.

A signal FnotesLoaded is emitted after loading.

              Constants

Offers these public constants, used by fnotview:
KeyClass_IVX = 0
KeyClass_ABC = 1
KeyClass_ivx = 2
KeyClass_abc = 3
KeyClass_123 = 4
KeyClass_sym = 5

              Query Methods

The following methods are provided for the use of the footnote view display.

    refresh(prog_bar) sweep the document and find all Anchors and Notes.
                      prog_bar is a QProgressDialog to update.

    count()           returns the number of items in the database.

    mismatches()      returns the integer count of mismatched Anchors
                      and Notes. (Nonzero means, cannot renumber or move.)

    key(n)            returns the KEY string for row n.

    key_class(n)      returns the CLASS (enum) for row n.

    anchor_line(n)    returns the line number of the anchor for n
                      or None if row n has no Anchor (unmatched Note)

    note_line(n)      returns the line number of the note for n
                      or None if row n has no Note (unmatched Anchor)

    note_size(n)      returns the number of lines in Note n or 0 if
                      row n has no Note (unmatched Anchor)

    note_text(n,t=0)  returns the initial t characters of the note N,
                      the full text "[Footnote K: ....]" when t=0.
                      returns an empty string if there is no Note n.

    set_key(n,key)    change key value of the Anchor/Note pair to
                      key (used when renumbering notes).

    find_zones()      sweep the document and find all /F..F/ markers,
                      and return the number found.

    move_notes()      move all notes that are not already in a footnote
                      section, into the next higher footnote section
                      if any. Notes in a section, and notes where there
                      is no following section, are not moved.


The Query methods take advantage of the expected sequence of calls to
QTableModel.data(): that it will call for each column of a single row before
moving on to the next row. On the first call for a given "n" row number, the
cursors for that row are used to derive five logical column values (key,
class, aline, nline, nlen) anticipating they will be called for sequentially.

Note on QTextCursor use: A QTextCursor has two values, anchor and position,
to define the text it selects. Qt doesn't care which is lower (closer to the
top of the doc) but QTextDocument.find() returns anchor < position(), i.e.
the cursor is "positioned" at the end of the found text, the anchor at the
start. So we try to keep that relation on all cursors.
